# GeoStatistic : Spatial Analysis 

 ## Overview
 
In this tutorial, we will explore some applications of data science on spatial data using R language.

Specifically, we will use:

Variogram to study spatial dependency between spatial data frame
Kriging and Simulation to interpolate properties values in a spatial data frame.
Those technics are used a lot in mining area for resource estimation.
